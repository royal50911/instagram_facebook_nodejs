COGS 121 Assignment 2 - Spring 2015
===========

Forked from Boilerplate code. C3 and D3 visualization of instagram data.

Principles of Design: 
(1) Visibilibity of System Status -- Evident by having a nav bar, with current location in site architecture highlighted in the navbar; also evident by loading symbol on C3 visualizaion.

(2) User control and freedom -- User can interact with data, including sorting and unsorting the d3 (old) visualization (we do NOT sort it immediately)
